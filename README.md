# Probem Statement
The employee performance data analysis project is like having a friendly chat about how everyone is doing at work. We look at things like how much work gets done, how good the work is, and how often people are at their desks. By taking a closer look at this information, we can spot what's going well and where there's room for improvement. This way, we can give helpful tips and advice to boost everyone's performance and make sure we're all moving in the same direction towards our company goals.

# Conclusion
Based on the performance data, it is observed that in each department, 100 or more employees, both male and female, have fully met the performance expectations. Additionally, in each department, 20 or fewer employees have exceeded these expectations. The remaining employees are categorized as needing "Performance Improvement Plans (PIP)" or as "Needs Improvement." These employees may require additional motivation, training, or practice to achieve efficient performance.
